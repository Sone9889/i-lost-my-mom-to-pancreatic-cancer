## My Story

Losing my mom has been one of the hardest experiences of my life. She was not just my mother; she was my best friend, my confidant, and my biggest supporter. Her diagnosis came as a shock. Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed late, and the journey was filled with ups and downs.

### The Diagnosis

When we first heard the news, it felt surreal. My mom showed no symptoms, and we had no idea what was coming. The doctors explained the severity of the situation and outlined treatment options. The word "chemotherapy" echoed in my mind, and I felt a wave of helplessness wash over me.

### The Treatment Journey

My mom faced her treatment with incredible strength. Each chemotherapy session was a battle, but she remained positive. I admired her resilience. I often sat with her during treatments, holding her hand and offering words of encouragement. Those moments were bittersweet, filled with love but shadowed by fear.

### The Final Days

As the cancer progressed, we had to confront the reality of her condition. The pain was unbearable, not just for her but for all of us who loved her. We focused on making her comfortable and cherishing every moment we had left together.

## Daily Journal Entries

Here, I will share my daily journal entries. These reflections capture my feelings, thoughts, and experiences as I navigate life after her passing.

### Entry 1: The Day After

The day after my mom passed, I felt lost. The world seemed dull and colorless. I wandered through her favorite places, hoping to feel her presence. Each corner held a memory, each shadow a reminder of her laughter.

### Entry 2: Finding Support

I reached out to friends and family, seeking comfort in shared memories. Talking about her helped me process my grief. I realized that I was not alone in this journey; many have faced similar losses and are willing to share their stories.

### Entry 3: Embracing the Pain

I learned that grief is not linear. Some days are harder than others. I allow myself to feel the pain, knowing that it is a part of healing. I write to express my emotions, letting the words flow freely.

## Understanding Pancreatic Cancer

Pancreatic cancer is a serious disease that often goes undetected until it reaches advanced stages. Here are some key points to understand:

- **Risk Factors**: Age, smoking, obesity, and family history can increase the risk.
- **Symptoms**: Early symptoms may include weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice.
- **Treatment Options**: Treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

- **Express Yourself Creatively**: Writing, painting, or other forms of art can help you process emotions.
